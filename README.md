# eShop

A rather simple online store essentially written in PHP. Academic project completed within a trimester. The Shop has two sides : Admin and customers. Both can modify existing accounts, or create a new one if wished. Customers can manage their own shopping cart, which remains saved even if they disconnect later on. Admins manage stocks and characteristics of their products and categories.

## Getting Started
